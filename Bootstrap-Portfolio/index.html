                        <p class="lead">Hello world! My name is Crystal, and I am brand new to the wonderful world of
                            programming.
                            I began my
                            professional career at the ripe age of 18 when I landed a job as an intern at a medical
                            billing
                            company. Fast forward 11 years and I am still in the medical billing industry, but got
                            quite the
                            taste
                            of technology along the way. The healthcare industry has a larger technology component than
                            the average
                            person
                            may
                            expect.
                            From the initial encounter at the hospital or doctor's office, to the payment made by the
                            insurance
                            companies,
                            there is an imense amount of information that needs to be tracked, organized, and exchanged
                            electronically.</p>

                            Many companies offer proprietary software as a service so that hospitals, doctors offices,
                            and
                            other
                            facilities can quickly and efficiently bill for services. Working at one of these companies
                            is
                            where I
                            got a small
                            glimpse into the programming required to create such impressive and complex software. This
                            exposure,
                            combined with my lifelong appreciation of logic and structure, led to my enrollment in the
                            CWRU
                            Bootcamp. I'm excited to see where this new chapter in my career will take me!</p>
